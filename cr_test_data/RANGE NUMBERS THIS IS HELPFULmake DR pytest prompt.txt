Look through my file repo in the attached zip (disregard concentration_response_dialog.py in the zip and refer to the one attached directly to this message instead) and help me explain to an LLM that I want to create a pytest to validate outputs from the "concentration_response_dialog.py" module. Your job is to provide the instructions that I give to the LLM, not to write the test script. The test needs to run from the command line. It should be as if the user started the program (main.py), clicked Tools > Concentration Response Analysis. Then click "Load CSV" in the new window and select '250202_007 dual range.csv' from root/cr_test_data. Then, change the "Start" field value to 24.30 and the "End" field to 28.70. Then click "Add Paired Background. A new analysis range will be created; change its "Start" value to 39.86 and "End" to 44.56. Then click "Add Range" and change its "Start" value to 68.38 and "End" to 71.53. Then click "Add Paired Background" and change its "Start" value to 81.57 and "End" to 85.40. Then click "Add Range" and change its "Start" value to 116.50 and "End" to 119.80. Then click "Add Paired Background" and change its "Start" value to 129.70 and "End" to 133.70. Then click "Add Range" and change its "Start" value to 159.85 and "End" to 164.44. Then click "Add Paired Background" and change its "Start" value to 177.34 and "End" to 186.23. Then click "Add Range" and change its "Start" value to 202.59 and "End" to 208.92. Then click "Add Paired Background" and change its "Start" value to 223.98 and "End" to 229.04.

Finally, click "Run Analysis" in the "Results" section, then "Export CSV(s)", then click 'OK' on the window that pops up. This should create two CSV files in cr_test_data. Compare the outputs to the files of the CSV files contained in cr_test_data/golden_DR_data.

Help me explain all this to the LLM, using the relationships between files in the zip
